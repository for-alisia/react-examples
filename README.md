# React Applications

This project is a my personal playground with React. There are various scenarios of using this library from the basics concepts to more advanced technics. Class-based component, functional components with hooks, state management and many other features.

## Seasons App (seasons folder)

Small basic application, that gets user's location using browser API and then shows different text based on his hemisphere. Just a few components like Spinner, Warning and Display. State managament through react's state and props, used class-based App component. For styling I used Semantic-UI library.
